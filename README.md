--------

Goals:
-------

Create recommendation system(s) using credit card transactional records. The data contains transactions from multiple users and contains GPS coordinates. 
The goals of the recommendation system(s) are as follows:

Goal #1.The recommendation system should recommend similar merchants to the customer based on similarities between the merchants

Goal #2.The recommendation system should recommend merchants to the customer based on their current location. 


Notebooks:
----------


Along with EDA.ipyb and pre-work for goal #2 notebooks (Recommendation_System_Location_Based_Pre_Work.ipynb) following notebooks capture the code for the two goals.

----A notebook titled "Recommendation_System_v1.ipynb" captures code for goal #1.
 
----A notebook titled "Recommendation_System_Location_Based_HDBSCAN.ipynb" captures code for goal #2.

(Note: A notebook titled "Recommendation_System_Location_Based_Kmeans.ipynb" captures code for goal #2 however it is only for learning purposes)


Reports:
--------

Documentation on the project (project presentation, milestone reports etc.) are provided in reports folder. This folder also contains figures used to create the reports.
