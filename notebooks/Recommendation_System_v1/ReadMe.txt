#recomm_sys_v1 helper functions

1. Function Name: merchCleanup(df, deleteList)
   Inputs: data frame (df), list of the merchants to be deleted 
		   from the merchant(simple_description) column (deleteList)
   Output: df with the dropped rows that matched values in deleteList
   
   
2. Function Name: top_merch(df,currentCatid,top_num=15):
   Inputs: data frame (df), category id (currentCatid) for which top merchants are needed, 
		   number of top merchants (top_num) 
   Output: top 'top_num' sorted list of top merchants in category 'currentCatId'
   
3. Function Name: createCatDF(df, categoryId, merch_list)
   Inputs:  data frame (df), category id (categoryId), 
		    list of merchants to be used to create a new data frame(merch_list)
   Output:  data frame with rows belonging to the category 'categoryId' and 
            merchant column matching values in 'merch_list'
			
4. Function Name: takeInputMerch(catid, df_cat,top_list):
   Inputs:  Category id (catid), data frame that was created by function 'createCatDF' (df_cat),
            list of top merchants returned from function 'top_merch'(top_list)
   Output:  This function shows 'top_list' and asks to pick one of the merchants. 
            Assigns the selected merchant to 'merchant_user_visited' and returns it
			
5. Function Name: filters(currentCatId,df,top_merch_list):
   Input:   category id 'currentCatId', data frame generated by function 'createCatDF',
            ,list of top merchants('top_merch_list') with which all the similarities be calculated and recommendations are created. List returned from 'top_merch' function
   Output:  Returns the two pandas series 'count_per_merch' and 'meanamt_per_merch'.
            'count_per_merch': popularity (number of visits by users) of other similar merchants
			'meanamt_per_merch: mean amount (dollars) spent by other users at the similar merchants
			
6. Function Name: recommendationSystem_A(merchant_user_visited,SimMethod,df_mtx,merchant_popularity_count,count_per_merch, meanamt_per_merch,Threshold_Sim_Score,\
                         Threshold_Num_MeanAmt, Threshold_Num_Visit,top_merch_list):
	Input:   merchant_user_visited: The merchant we are comparing other merchants to
	         SimMethod: 'Pearson' or 'Cosine'
	         df_mtx: The sparse matrix created for similarity calculations between uid and merchants
	         merchant_popularity_count: A series created showing visits of users to the merchant 'merchant_user_visited'
	         count_per_merch: series returned by function 'filters'
                 meanamt_per_merch: series returned by function 'filters'
		Threshold_Sim_Score: Minimum similarity score at which two merchants are considered 'similar'. (0=too tolerant (accept all), 1: no tolerance(accept none))
		The value is set in the main script
		Threshold_Num_MeanAmt: Minimum mean amount of dollars spent on the merchants in the data frame to be considered for recommendations. The value is set in the main script
		Threshold_Num_Visit: Minimum number of visits (count of records) to the merchants in the data frame to be considered for recommendations. The value is set in the main
		top_merch_list: List of top merchants with which all similarities be calculated and recommendations are created. List returned from 'top_merch' function
	Output: Based on either Cosine SimMethod or Pearson SimMethod, Top recommendations are returned in the form of list

7. Function Name: recommendationSystem_B(merchant_user_visited,df_mtx,merchant_popularity_count,count_per_merch,meanamt_per_merch,\
                                           Threshold_Sim_Score,Threshold_Num_MeanAmt,Threshold_Num_Visit,top_merch_list)
                 Inputs: See function recommendationSystem_A above for definitions of the input variables
                 Outputs: recommendation based on combined logic between cosine and pearson in the form of list

8. Function Name: recommendationSystem_C(merchant_user_visited,SimMethod,df_mtx,merchant_popularity_count,count_per_merch,\
                                meanamt_per_merch,top_merch_list)
		  Inputs: See function recommendationSystem_A above for definitions of the input variables
                  Outputs: recommendation based on either pearson or cosine similarity scores. 
                           The difference between recommendationsystem_A/B with C is that C only considered similarity scores for results and the results are 
                           displayed as a dictionary with keys as top merchants and values as similarity scores
