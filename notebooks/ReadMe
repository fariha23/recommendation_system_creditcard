**This folder contains ipynbs, python code and helper code used with the notebooks to accomplish the goals of this project**

Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) files:
  Files EDA.ipyb, EDA.py are same. EDA.py is used to import it's code to other files in order to limit the repeatabiliy 
  The file eda_helper.py contains all the functions used in EDA.ipynb. The documentation on these functions can be found in <>

Recommendation_System_v1 files:
    Files Recommendation_System_v1.ipynb and Recommendation_System_v1.py are exactly the same. Recommendation_System_v1.py is used to import code (dataframes) to other files 
    in order to limit the repeatability
    The file recomm_sys_v1_helper.py contains all the functions used in Files Recommendation_System_v1.ipynb. The documentation on these functions can be found in <>
 
Recommendation_System_Location_Based files:
    File titled Recommendation_System_Location_Based_Pre_Work.ipynb and Recommendation_System_Location_Based_Pre_Work.py are exactly the same. The latter is used to 
    import code to other files in order to limit repeatability. There are several functions used in this file and documentation of these functions can be found at <>
    File titled Recommendation_System_Location_Based_HDBSCAN.ipynb contains recommendation code using Hierarchical Density Based Spatial Clustering Algorithm with Noise (HDBSCAN) 
    clustering algorithm. There are a few functions used in this file and documentation of these functions can be found at <>
    File titled Recommendation_System_Location_Based_KMeans.ipynb contains recommendation code using KMeans clustering algorithm. There are a few functions used in this 
    file and documentation of these functions can be found at <>
